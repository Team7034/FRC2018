	//Recognition of Kana characters may have been biased in favor of the CANN. Jisho.org automatically converts text into Kana, so searching based off of a Kana's sound does not yield any results for the actual Kana character. To compensate, the context system checked if the character was Kana and gave it a frequency of 0.5. This value was chosen due to the fact that each sound has two seperate characters, one in Hiragana and one in Katakana. However this value is about 0.35 larger than most results for Kanji characters, due to the greater number of results. Further investigation of this value is needed to determine its factor in the CANN's performance.
	
	//Another limiting factor in the model's performance was the performance of the MANN. The MANN was trained with a persistent memory due to the need to remember all trained characters, not only a small subset. Santoro et al. (2016) showed that a persistent memory increased the number of training episodes as well as reduced the accuracy. They only tested 5 and 10 classes per episode with a persistent memory, with scores of about 0.8 and 0.95 respectively at the end of training. After training this MANN on 15 classes with a persistent memory, final accuracy varied anywhere from about 0.4 to 0.7. Part of this accuracy drop can be explained by the addition of an extra character in the five-hot label. Another disparity between this number and the model's performance in testing can be explained by teaching it 99 classes instead of only 15. Further research can be done on optimizing the performance of the MANN by changing hyperparameters such as memory size.
